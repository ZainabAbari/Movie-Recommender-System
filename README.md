# Movie-Recommender-System
A Movie Recommendation App using Streamlit &amp; Machine Learning

This project is a Content-Based Movie Recommender System that suggests movies based on genre similarity using:
1. Cosine Similarity
2. CountVectorizer
3. Nearest Neighbors Algorithm

Users can select any movie and receive recommended titles instantly through an interactive Streamlit web app.
*This project demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, deployment, and ML model building*

### Datasets
MovieLens dataset (movies + ratings):
1. movies.csv — movie titles and genres
2. ratings.csv — user ratings
*The model uses only movie genres to compute similarity*
---

### Data Cleaning & Preparation
1. Converted timestamps
2. Cleaned and standardized movie titles and genres
3. Merged ratings with movie metadata
4.  Created genre vectors using CountVectorizer
  *This project demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, deployment, and ML model building*
