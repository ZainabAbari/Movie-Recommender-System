# Movie-Recommender-System
A Movie Recommendation App using Streamlit &amp; Machine Learning

This project is a Content-Based Movie Recommender System that suggests movies based on genre similarity using:
-Cosine Similarity
-CountVectorizer
-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm

Users can select any movie and receive recommended titles instantly through an interactive Streamlit web app.
*This project demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, deployment, and ML model building*

### Datasets
MovieLens dataset (movies + ratings):
-movies.csv — movie titles and genres
-ratings.csv — user ratings
*The model uses only movie genres to compute similarity*
